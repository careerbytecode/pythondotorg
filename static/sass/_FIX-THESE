TO DO: 
***

Blockquotes should not have a FOOTER element inside of them. Change markup and associated CSS. Fix also .success-stories-widget and .success-quote.

-999em or -9999em is too large. Use pixels in this case or the browser could use too much memory rendering the absurdly large distance. 

Drop down menus with right: -999em styles produce a horiz scroll bar in Chrome. 

Make the breakpoints in layout.scss work on variables. Easier to change in one place than in both the layout and mq files. 

Bring in the latest html5 reset function (from WPS?)
Make a .text set of styles more persistent. From WPS schools. 

Replace this nasty line of code... ul ul, ul ul ul, ol ol, ol ol ol, ul ol, ul ol ul, ol ul, ol ul ol { margin-bottom: 0; }

Convert the .list-row-container ULs/OLs to use table-row and table-cell display properties? Test in IE. Benefits? Maybe none.
